      Where to install Juju GUI from. Possible values the following.
      - 'local' (default): The latest local release will be deployed. Releases
        are stored in the releases directory of this charm.
      - 'stable': The latest release from the "stable" series will be deployed.
      - 'develop': The latest, in development, version from the Git repository.
      - a specific release version (e.g '0.1.0' or '0.1.0+build.1'): The
        specified stable version will be deployed. A suitable release is
        looked up in the local releases repository (see the "local" choice
        above). If not found locally, the release will be downloaded from
        Launchpad.
      - a Git branch (e.g. 'https://github.com/juju/juju-gui.git' or
        'https://github.com/mitechie/juju-gui.git updated-test-runner'): A
        release will be created and deployed from the specified Git
        repository. You can include a branch name or a specific commit SHA
        after the url to the Git repository to deploy that specific commit
        point. You may instead specify a commit SHA: (e.g.
        'https://github.com/mitechie/juju-gui.git @de5e61bf9fa') which will
        clone the git repository and then check out the specified commit
        before building the release.
      - a URL: The release found at the given URL (ex: http://...) will be
        deployed.

  repository-location:
    description: |
      The charm depends on several software packages that are not packaged in
      Ubuntu.  In order to ensure that only versions known to work with our
      charm are used, there is a single PPA where all packages are kept.  The
      juju-gui-charmers team supports 'stable' and 'devel' versions.  Only
      stable should be used for production.  For enterprise deployments that
      do not allow access to resources outside of their control, the location
      can be any specification as long as it is recognizable by
      'add-apt-repository'.
    type: string
    default: ppa:juju-gui-charmers/stable
  ga-key:
    description: |
      The Google Analytics key to use.  Set to blank to disable analytics.
      The team developing the Juju GUI benefits from understanding how
      different deployments use the tool.  By keeping the default key value,
      anonymized usage data is reported back using Google Analytics.  The type
      of data collected includes the charms that are deployed and the number
      of units per service.  Use of analytics is optional but we hope you will
      allow us to improve our tool based on your experience.

    description: |
      Used by the nrpe-external-master subordinate charm.
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you are running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
    type: string
    default: "juju"
  cached-fonts:
    description: |
      Configure the GUI to use locally cached fonts, rather than the Google CDN
      as supplied by the Google fonts API.  The CDN is faster in almost every
      circumstance except local (LXC) environments, and so it is the default;
      but if a browser is running the GUI on a closed network, using cached
      fonts will let the GUI load much faster and render properly.
    type: boolean
    default: false
  juju-core-version:
    description: |
      The version of Juju tools used for the charm deployment. If left empty,
      the Juju version is dynamically retrieved.
