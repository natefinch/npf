 I have been a professional developer since 1999 after graduating with a CS
 degree from [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/).  I spent
 13 years developing in C++ and C# in various startups before picking up Go in
 2012.

I previously worked as a Gopher at [Canonical](http://www.canonical.com), working on
[juju](https://jujucharms.com), a distributed application deployment system similar to Kubernetes,
and one of the largest open source Go projects at the time.

Since 2017 I have been a Principal Engineer and Senior Engineering Manager at Mattel, building a
distributed platform development team that has launched many successful projects including backend
systems used by the Fisher-Price SmartConnect line of smart devices, the Hot Wheels Augmoto and Hot
Wheels ID augmented reality mobile games, and https://hotwheelscollectors.com.

I started the Go Boston Google+ group which became the first major meetup for Go
programmers in Boston and eventually became the Boston Golang meetup group.  I
was an organizer of the Framingham, MA Go Meetup.  

I have written a ton of Go packages and commands, some of the most popular being
[Mage](https://github.com/magefile/mage)
[Lumberjack](https://github.com/natefinch/lumberjack),
[Gnorm](https://github.com/gnormal/gnorm),
[pie](https://github.com/natefinch/pie), and
[gorram](https://github.com/natefinch/gorram)

When I'm not coding, I'm spending time with my family in the outer Boston suburbs of Massachusetts,
participating in local government, and looking for ways to make the world a better place for
everyone. I love tabletop gaming and have been playing D&D since the 80's.
