I have been developing software in Go since 2012. I currently work at
[GitHub](https://github.com) to try to make the world a better place for
developers, so they can make the world a better place for everyone else.

I have written a ton of Go packages and commands, some of the most popular being
[Mage](https://github.com/magefile/mage)
[Lumberjack](https://github.com/natefinch/lumberjack),
[Gnorm](https://github.com/gnormal/gnorm),
[pie](https://github.com/natefinch/pie), and
[gorram](https://github.com/natefinch/gorram)

When I'm not coding, I'm spending time with my family in the suburbs of
Massachusetts, participating in local government, and looking for ways to make
the world a better place for everyone. I love tabletop gaming and have been
playing D&D since the 80's.
